  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
  <strong>The Control <u>international</u> trade fair</strong> for quality assurance, which will be held at the Stuttgart Exhibition Centre from 5th to 8th May 2020, provides suppliers and users with a globally recognised technical event which is focused strictly on relevant issues. The trade fair explores all pertinent aspects in theory and offers a highly practical presentation of current worldwide offerings for useful technologies, processes, products and system solutions in the field of industrial quality assurance. And thus the nearly 900 manufacturers and exhibitors of QA equipment represented at Control make it possible for manufacturing companies and their suppliers to hone their competitive edge. The supplementary programme with world-class participants and the comprehensive exhibition and information portfolio will once again transform Stuttgart into the business Mecca of the QA industry in the spring of 2020.
